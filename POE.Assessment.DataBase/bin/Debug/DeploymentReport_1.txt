     Possible data issues
       The column [school].[ModuleInformation].[UserId] is being dropped, data loss could occur.
       The column [school].[ModuleInformation].[StudentInformationId] on table [school].[ModuleInformation] must be added, but
         the column has no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not
         work. To avoid this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable
         the generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
